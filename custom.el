;; Emacs Prelude modules
;;
;; Prelude has its own way of configuring modules, badly enough
;; it is not based on use-package, which seems to be the standard.
;; Anyway, the following modules include lots of interesting
;; configurations that are worth having; actually, most of them
;; are 99% the Prelude experience.
;;
;; These are supposed to be in `.emacs.d/prelude-modules.el` but I
;; like having a centralized configuration.
;;
;; Python module:
;; Prelude ships with `anaconda-mode` which I don't like. That's why
;; that module is disabled and `elpy` is enabled instead with
;; `use-package`.
